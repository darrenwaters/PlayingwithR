Import 2 datasets into my project.
First - dwellings stock data for Wales

```{r}
stockwales2018 <- read.csv('totalstock.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Secodly - an XLS file of lots of LA data for many year. This is going to prove tricky! I'm pulling in just one sheet - 17 - into a variable called house prices

```{r}
houseprices <- read_excel('hpssadataset11medianpricepaidforadmingeosexisting.xls', 17)
```

Because of the way my data is structured there are not neat column heads at row 1 of the sheet. What I want to try and do is pull out one column of data.

```{r}
YearendingDec2019 <- houseprices$...101
```

The above command has just pulled the values from column 101. I'm not sure that's what I really intended. But I'm guessing I can now try and pull the names of the counties and combine them

```{r}
Counties <- houseprices$...2
```

```{r}
combinedLAprices <- merge(Counties,YearendingDec2019)
```

So the above hasn't worked - so I'm going to try to use rbind

```{r}
taketwocombined <- rbind(Counties,YearendingDec2019)
```

So that didn't work so I tried cbind in the console takethreecombined <- cbind(Counties,YearendingDec2019) and that appears to have worked. Now to write that file as a csv

```{r}
write.csv(takethreecombined, file = "LAandprice.csv")
```
Now I'm going to try and match the data in the combined LA and price with the stock in Wales. I think that involves bind rows. So let's try it.

```{r}
stock.and.prices <- bind_rows(takethreecombined,stockwales2018)
```
That didn't work so I'm going to import the csv file I exported to see if that makes a difference.

```{r}
pricesLA <- read.csv('LAandprice.csv')
```

Okay I've gone horribly wrong - but I know why. I've imported the wrong column. so let's start that again.

```{r}
newounties <- houseprices$...4
```

```{r}
newcombinedlaprices <- cbind(newounties,YearendingDec2019st)
```


Think I'm getting somewhere so I'm now going to try again to export the combined data above in 66 as a .csv, reimport and then combine. Perhaps I'll try to combine withou the export.

```{r}
stockandprices <- bind_rows('newcombinedlaprices,stockwales2018')
```
Nope. Still struggling.

```{r}
write.csv(newcombinedlaprices, file = 'newcombined.csv')
```

so lets import that now

```{r}
LAprices <- read.csv('newcombined.csv')
```


```{r}
alldatacombined <- rbind('LAprices,stockwales2018')
```
```{r}
newalldatacombined <- merge('updatedLA','stockwales2018')
```
